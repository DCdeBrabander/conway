## But why? 
First, I always wanted to build my own implementation of G.O.L.  
Second, I wanted to challenge myself a little and so I created basically just a playground to practice some minor things:
1. setup typescript/ts-node/esbuild compile-and-bundle process
2. Mess around with canvas/drawing a bit
3. Mess around with Typescript
4. Potentially practice with some data-structures, optimization and the like
